## Overview
In this project I analyzed an HR dataset to uncover insight about the performance of employees in TM plc across the different department in the firm alongside other parameters including gender, age, region and education as a performance parameter for measuring their performance respectively. Several insights were uncovered including the performance of the female gender which was higher than that of the male employees who records a larger number in population.

## Business Questions
- How is the workforce distributed across different departments and regions, and what insights can be drawn from this distribution?
- What are the variations in education levels among employees across different departments or regions, and how does this impact organizational dynamics?
- Is there a gender imbalance within the organization, and what strategies can be implemented to address this issue?
- Which recruitment channels have proven most effective in attracting new employees, and how can this information be leveraged for future recruitment efforts?
- What is the average number of training sessions attended by employees, and how does this impact their performance and career development?
- How does the average age of employees vary across departments or regions, and what implications does this have for workforce planning and management?
- What is the distribution of previous year performance ratings among employees, and how can this data be used to identify areas for improvement and recognition?
- How does the length of service vary across different departments or regions, and what impact does this have on employee retention and engagement?
- What percentage of employees have met or exceeded Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) set at >80%, and how does this reflect on overall organizational performance?
- What is the rate of winning awards among employees, and how does this contribute to employee motivation and engagement?
- What is the average training score attained by employees, and how does this reflect on the effectiveness of training programs?
- What is the promotion rate within the organization, and how can this be optimized to ensure career progression and talent retention?

## Analysis Findings and Recommendations

- The charts shows that there is a bias in the number of male employed into the TMplc compared to the male. The percentage comparison is at 80% male to 20% female. further analysis shows that in the training performance score alongside the KPI perforformance rating reveals that the female gender are doing excellently well compared to the men which raises a question why the number of female gender is relatively low compared to the number of men despite their sterling performance. I will suggest that the recruitment process should be fair and equity should be considered in the process. 

- The KPI rating by education levels shows that employees in the below secondary level are performing up to the requisite expectation and standard even far beyond those with Bachelor's or Masters

-  Proper performance assessment should be conducted for the employees in region 2 as they have quite a high number at such great numbers compared to every other regions and the KPI performance by region reveals that region 2 wasnt part of the top 8 best peforming region averagely, this should be looked into and a thorough assessment should be conducted alongside trainings and assessment that can boost their peformance.

- The operations department has been the best performing deprtment so far followed by R & D, however the sales and marketing department which has the highest number of employees is the lowest performing, this really needs to be reviewed as it is the bedrock of revenue generation for the firm.
